# Isabella Kroon

Hi! My name is Isabella Kroon. I am a junior dual-enrolled at Duke and Duke Kunshan University. I am majoring in Computation and Design with an Environmental Sustainability concentration. I'm interested in how statistics and computation can be used to understand environmental issues and better inform environmental policy.
